# Stocard Importer

The `app/src/main/res/raw/stocard_stores.csv` CSV file used by the Stocard importer was created using the `.scripts/dump_stocard_stores.py` script.

Only used for data portability reasons (ensuring importing works). Do NOT copy this anywhere else or use it for any purpose other than ensuring we can import a GDPR-provided export. We want to make sure this stays under fair use.
